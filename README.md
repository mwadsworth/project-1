This site uses Jquery, Javascript, AJAX, API's, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, CORS-anywhere, and a widget. 

This application uses multiple API's at once to help you find all your needs when traveling. If you are traveling to a new city for any occasion and want to know what is 
going on in that specific area.. A Way Away can help. 

When the user inputs a city into the search bar, "Denver" for example.. The site will take the input and using the Openweather API will convert the city into coordinates
(latitude and longitude). The coordinates are then entered into 2 other API's Zomato and Dark Sky. Zomato will display hot restaurants by different categories, while
Dark Sky loads a 7 day forecast (8 including the present day). This application will then take the original search of "Denver" and load up all events from Ticketmaster and prepend
them onto the page. On the top of the page you will see a widget that can be used to access a different website to purchase tickets to your destination of choice.
